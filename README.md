This is my first attempt to create a personal website. My goal is to incorporate various features and code that I learned
along the way.
The main page uses the following additional files/libraries:

CSS
1. Reset CSS: Resets the styling of all HTML elements so that we can start to build our own styling from scratch
2. lightbox.css: overlays images on top of current page
3. google webfonts

JS
1. Modernizr.js: a feature detection library for HTML5 and CSS3. It let's you easily detect whether a browser supports a specific feature or not. It also comes with html5shiv which enables HTML5 elements in IE.
2. Respond.js: a script which enables responsive design in IE and other browsers which don't support CSS Media Queries.
3. jQuery.js: version 1.10.2 
4. lightbox2.js: overlay images on top of current page
5. prefixfree.js: automatically creates the required prefixes and let's us write the unprefixed CSS properties.
6. jquery.slides.min.js: a responsive slideshow plug-in for jQuery (1.7.1) with features like touch and CSS3 transitions.
